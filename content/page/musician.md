# Philosophy

> Some of my earliest memories are my fascination of music. It was and always will be a part of my live.
> As they say: **The creative adult is the child, who survived**. I am always trying to discover new things, as I beleive that curiousity is the main drive of humanity. My desire to discover new stuff, also applies to music, hence my decision to start composing.
> Even when studying well-known repertoire there is always room for new discoveries.
> I listen to a very wide variety of music, and am interested in a lot of genres (such as jazz).
