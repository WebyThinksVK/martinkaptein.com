# Playing around with ADB

In this Blog post, I would like to take a look at ADB, which stands for Android Debug Bridge. It is a tool, which can do a surprising amount of stuff, which I was pleased to discover.

For this, I am going to use my Nexus 4, [about which I have already written a lot of posts](../../tags/nexus4) running the latest Lineage OS (at the time of writing it’s 15.1), which corresponds to Android 8.1 (which is quite amazing for such an old device, isn’t it).

I am not really sure whether other devices also support stuff like ADB over network in their stock rom (please let me know in the comments). 

Anyway, this post is just about my experiences with ADB so far besides the usual commands the modders and rooters from you already know for sure.
