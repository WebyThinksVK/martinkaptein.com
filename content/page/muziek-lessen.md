# Piano and music theory lessons

I give classical piano lessons in many different languages (Dutch, English, German and Russian) for beginners and advanced students alike, from all ages. Individual lessons are preferable.

Also, I teach elementary music theory such as solfeggio (also in the languages Dutch, English, German and Russian).

## For whom

My piano lessons are suited for beginners, and advanced piano students alike.
It doesn't matter whether you haven't touched a piano in your life, or if you are already a professional.

For music theory I target absolute beginners, with whom we develop a good and strong basis for further studies. 

### Theory

I help to create a good set of basic knowledge of:

- harmony
- music history
- analysis
- solfeggio and ear training skills

## Where

I give lessons in the vicinity of Enschede, The Netherlands. It is possible to arrange me to visit the student at home, but also at the ArtEz conservatory in Enschede.
Also, I am regularly in the ArtEz conservatory in Zwolle, there I also give lessons.

#### Adresses

**ArtEz Enschede:** Van Essengaarde 10, 7511 PN Enschede

**ArtEz Zwolle:** Aan de Stadsmuur 88, 8011 VD Zwolle

*Private lessons at home of the student are possible in the vicinity of Enschede.*

## My piano teaching philosophy and system

Generally speaking, my philosophy is to make the lessons **as interesting as possible and to spark interest in the student**.

Personally, I have been taught with the **Russian piano school**. My philosophy is to bring some elements of it to the Netherlands, in a **very accessible and friendly form**:

To sum up, the most important element is the individual approach for each student. The **individuality** of each performer is the hallmark of the Russian piano school.

These elements include the attention to the **right playing techniques** (such as position of the hand, fingers and generally motorics) which is really important to be taught correctly.

However, this will be accomplished less by playing technical exercises such as scales and arpeggioâ€™s but **focusing on actual music**. 

This will lead to the student developing a good technique while also combining it with an **artistic sense**. **The music comes first**, everything else is a result of it.

The emotional colours and dynamic values of the sound have to persistently be watched when practicing and playing the piano, because just these elements determine the whole future technical progress of the piano students.
